Here's a listing of a few of my side projects.

## hereby

[hereby](https://hereby.js.org) is a simple task runner. I created it during the
conversion of TypeScript so I could better represent the dependency graph of all
of our build steps, as well as eliminate a huge swath of devDependencies.

Go ahead and use it, if you dare; the only user I plan on actually supporting is
TypeScript itself, though some daring projects appear to have switched to it.

## pyright-action

[pyright-action](https://github.com/jakebailey/pyright-action) is a GitHub
Action for pyright, allowing for fast execution through caching and PR comments
for errors.

## pprof-it

[pprof-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pprof-it) is a little wrapper for
pprof, allowing for quick and easy profiling of Node programs. If I'm profiling
something that can be run at the CLI, I'm using this.

## esbuild-playground

[esbuild-playground](https://jakebailey.dev/esbuild-playground/) is "yet
another" playground for esbuild. Like the TypeScript playground, it supports
links and auto-compiles as you type. It's very basic right now, but whenever I
get some free time (hah) I'll expand it.
